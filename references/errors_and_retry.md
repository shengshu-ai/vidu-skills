# Errors and Retry Strategy (vidu-cli)

CLI JSON shapes: **parameters.md** (canonical). This file focuses on **task lifecycle** and **retry** behavior.

---

## Task state lifecycle

Typical order: `created` → `queueing` → `preparation` → `scheduling` → `processing` → **`success`** or **`failed`** (or `canceled`).

Terminal states: **`success`**, **`failed`**, **`canceled`**. Do not treat other states as final.

---

## When `state` is `failed`

- **`err_code`**: Server-defined code (in `vidu-cli task get` response when available). Common codes include `INVALID_PROMPT_LENGTH`, `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`, `CONTENT_MODERATION`, `TASK_TIMEOUT`. Always report the exact code — do not interpret or translate.
- **`err_msg`**: Human-readable message when present.

Tell the user the task failed and pass through **`err_code`** / **`err_msg`**. Do not return media URLs.

---

## Polling results

The CLI does **not** block waiting for task completion: `vidu-cli task submit` returns `task_id` immediately; the caller must poll with **`vidu-cli task get <task_id>`** in a loop until a terminal state is reached.

**Recommended polling strategy**: poll every **3–5 seconds** for active tasks. For tasks expected to take longer (e.g. 16s video generation), start with a 5s interval and increase to 10s after the first minute.

- **`vidu-cli task get`** is read-only and safe to repeat (poll until terminal state or timeout).
- **`vidu-cli task get <task_id> --output <dir>`** downloads media files on success.

## Submit-time errors

### Quick fix table

| stderr contains | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `unexpected argument '--output'` | `--output` was used on `task submit` or another command that does not support it | Remove `--output` from submit; download with `vidu-cli task get <task_id> -o <dir>` after success |
| `unrecognized subcommand 'download'` | `vidu-cli task download` does not exist | Use `vidu-cli task get <task_id> -o <dir>` |
| `invalid value for --material` | Material value has the wrong `name:id:version` shape | Use one `--material "NAME:ELEMENT_ID:VERSION"` per element |
| material value contains `,` | Multiple materials were comma-joined into one flag | Split into repeated `--material` flags |
| material value contains two `name:id:version` groups in one string | Multiple materials were space-joined into one flag | Split into repeated `--material` flags |
| `Required: --voice-id` | TTS was called without a voice ID | Run `vidu-cli task tts-voices`, choose an exact TTS voice ID, then call `vidu-cli task tts --prompt ... --voice-id ...` |
| `unrecognized subcommand 'tts'` with top-level `Usage: vidu-cli [COMMAND]` | Command shape was corrupted, commonly by wrapping `vidu-cli` in `sh -c` or using the wrong top-level form | Use direct argv: `["vidu-cli","task","tts","--prompt","...","--voice-id","..."]` |
| `task submit --type tts` | TTS was routed through the generic submit path | Use `vidu-cli task tts`, then poll with `vidu-cli task get <task_id>` |
| `submit succeeded but no task_id found` | CLI output did not contain a provider task id | Inspect stdout/stderr exactly; do not resubmit until the first submit result is understood |
| `ClawPassExplicitModeRequired` | Auto-selected claw-pass quota is exhausted | Do not retry automatically; use `--schedule-mode normal` only if the user agrees to spend credits |
| `unexpected argument '--model'` | Used a non-existent flag name | Replace with `--model-version` |
| `unexpected argument '--voice'` | Used the old TTS flag name | Replace with `--voice-id` |
| `unexpected argument '--motion-prompt'`, `--negative-prompt`, `--prompt-file`, `--mode` | Invented flags that the CLI does not support | Remove invented flags and rebuild the command from `vidu-cli ... --help` |
| `invalid value '10s' for '--duration <DURATION>'` | Duration was passed as a string with a unit suffix | Pass integer seconds only, e.g. `10` |
| `... with 3.2_a should not include transition` | `--transition` was passed to a task/model pair that rejects it | Remove `--transition`; `3.2_a` does not accept it for `text2video` or `character2video` |
| `Invalid voice_id '...'` | Voice ID is not in the current TTS voice catalog | Run `vidu-cli task tts-voices`, choose an exact returned ID, and resubmit |

### `ClawPassExplicitModeRequired`

Returned on submit when `--schedule-mode` is omitted (auto-detected as `claw_pass`) but the user's daily claw-pass quota is exhausted. This is a **4xx submit error** (appears in `error.code`), not a task-state failure. **Do not retry** — inform the user that their daily quota is used up. They can either wait for the next refresh or re-submit with `--schedule-mode normal` to use credits instead.

## Network and client errors (CLI `ok: false`)

- **4xx on submit**: Inspect `error.type`, `code`, `message`; fix parameters or token. **Do not retry** — 4xx errors indicate invalid input or authentication issues that won't resolve by retrying.
- **CLI validation / clap parse errors** such as `unexpected argument`, `invalid value`, or missing required flags: **Do not retry**. These are local command-shape bugs, not transient failures.
- **5xx or connection error on submit**: Retry with backoff (e.g. 1s, 2s, 4s), limited attempts (e.g. up to 3). If still failing, report the error to the user.
- **Upload / network errors** during image handling: Same idea — bounded retries, then surface **`error`** fields verbatim.
- **Timeouts on `task get`**: Retry once or twice with a 30-second timeout per request; if still failing, report that the result could not be fetched and suggest trying again later.

---

## Summary for agents

- Treat only **`success`** / **`failed`** / **`canceled`** as terminal (for task `state`).
- On **`failed`**: return **`err_code`** / **`err_msg`**, no media link.
- **No built-in wait**: the CLI returns immediately after submit; poll with **`vidu-cli task get`** every 3–5 seconds until done.
- On transport or ambiguous failures: limited backoff retries, then report **`error`** from stdout exactly as **`parameters.md`** describes.
